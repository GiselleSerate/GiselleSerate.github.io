It's high time I had a website. This is that. Well, not this. [This is.](http://GiselleSerate.github.io)

Hi, Giselle. Is the website not updating, even though it works on localhost? You might have forgotten to . . . 
* run `npm run build`
* drag the generated files from dist to root
* merge the branch you were working on into master
